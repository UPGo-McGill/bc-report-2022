## Methodology

Census Metropolitan Areas (CMA), Census Agglomerations (CA), non-urban areas, and resort towns. Resort towns are municipalities that, according the census, have 12% or more of their labor employed in entertainment and recreation and accommodation and food businesses. Within the CMAs, we also differentiate between the entire CMA and the city centres, which include the cities of Vancouver, Victoria, and Abottsford.
