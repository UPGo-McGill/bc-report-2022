## Short-term rentals in British Columbia: Market overview

Key findings:

1.  Listing inventory is still far below pre-Covid, but revenue, pricing and revenue per listing have mostly recovered.
2.  Strong divergence between big cities and mid-tier/resort cities.
3.  Collapse in year-round STRs during the pandemic, but recovery already started in 2021.

### Active listings and host revenue

In 2021, there was an average of TKTK short-term rental listings active each day in the province of British Columbia. (Active listings are those which are not just displayed on a STR platform, but are either reserved or available for reservations, and they are the most straightforward way to assess the size of an STR market.) Setting aside the TKTK listings which were for hotels, B&Bs, and other non-housing properties, this leaves TKTK listings operated out of houses in BC. These listings were operated by TKTK hosts, who collectively earned \$TKTK million in revenue (an average of \$TKTK per listing, and a median of \$TKTK per listing).

These figures are all dramatically lower than the same ones for 2019---before the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2019, there were TKTK daily active listings operated out of houses in BC (TK% higher than 2021). These listings were operated by TKTK hosts (TK% higher), who collectively earned \$TKTK million in revenue (TK% higher), with an average of \$TKTK (TK% higher), and a median of \$TKTK (TK% higher) per listing.

(In what follows, we present figures from 2021---the most recent complete year, but one which is likely to be a historic low point for the STR market due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Where relevant, we also present figures from 2019---the last full year prior to the pandemic, and hence a plausible baseline for the STR market once the pandemic has subsided.)

### Home sharers and commercial operators

An important distinction in STR markets is between "home sharing" and "commercial operations". Home sharing occurs when the principal resident of a housing unit rents out part or all of that housing unit on a temporary basis. A family with a spare bedroom that they rent on Airbnb as a private-room listing is an example of home sharing, as is a condo unit whose occupant travels frequently for business, and rents out the entire unit when she is out of town. A commercial operation, by contrast, is an STR listing which is *not* located in the host's principal residence, and is operated in a more or less full-time fashion. Unlike home sharing arrangements, commercial STRs remove housing units from the long-term market, since each housing unit which is being operated as a full-time STR could instead be housing a long-term resident.

One way to distinguish between commercial operators and home sharers is to look at what type of listings are operated on STR platforms. STR listings can be entire-home or private-room, and the former is much more likely to be a home sharing arrangement than the latter. (Listings can also be shared-room, but these are very rare.) The overwhelming majority of the STR listings active in 2021 were entire homes (TK%), and this proportion increased noticeably during the pandemic, presumably in part because non-commercial STR operators have become less willing to share their homes with strangers.

Another way to distinguish between home sharers and commercial operators is to examine the distribution of revenue among hosts. If revenue is evenly distributed among a large number of hosts earning modest amounts of money, that suggests that home sharing is common. If, by contrast, revenue is concentrated among a small number of high earners, that suggests that most STR activity is conducted by commercial operators, regardless of how many hosts are active on the platform. Across British Columbia, host revenue in 2021 was in fact highly concentrated. The top 10% of hosts earned TKTK% of all revenue, while the top 1% of hosts---just TKTK operators---earned TKTK% of revenue. By contrast, the median host earned \$TKTK in 2021. This pattern suggests that BC has a large number of hosts who are are casual home sharers, but that the STR market is dominated by a much smaller number of commercial operators.
