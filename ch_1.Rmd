## Short-term rentals in British Columbia: Market overview

In 2021, there was an average of TKTK short-term rental listings active each day in the province of British Columbia. (Active listings are those which are not just displayed on a STR platform, but are either reserved or available for reservations, and they are the most straightforward way to assess the size of an STR market.) Setting aside the TKTK listings which were for hotels, B&Bs, and other non-housing properties, this leaves TKTK listings operated out of houses in BC. These listings were operated by TKTK hosts, who collectively earned $TKTK million in revenue (an average of $TKTK per listing, and a median of $TKTK per listing).

These figures are all dramatically lower than the same ones for 2019—before the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2019, there were TKTK daily active listings operated out of houses in BC (TK% higher than 2021). These listings were operated by TKTK hosts (TK% higher), who collectively earned $TKTK million in revenue (TK% higher), with an average of $TKTK (TK% higher), and a median of $TKTK (TK% higher) per listing.

(In what follows, we present figures from 2021—the most recent complete year, but one which is likely to be a historic low point for the STR market due to the Covid-19 pandemic—and also from 2019—the last full year prior to the pandemic, and hence a plausible baseline for the STR market once the pandemic has subsided.)
